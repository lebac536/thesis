            <h1>MY CONFLICTING FEELINGS ABOUT AMERICA, CITIZENSHIP, AND THE CONCEPT OF 'HOME'</h1>
            <p>
                I think I feel weird about this especially now, mid <span class="image-container">citizenship process, <img src="images/citizenship.png" alt="citizenship" class="image"> </span> I have lived in this country for <span class="image-container">10 years <img src="images/10years.png" alt="me when we moved" class="image"> </span> now (as seen by my very recently <span class="image-container"> expired green card). <img src="images/greencard.png" alt="my greencard" class="image"> </span>
    
            </p>

            <p>
                I feel weird finally doing it because for years my parents have been saying to do it, but I was stubborn and thought I'd leave before I would have to make the decision to. Now it's here and might as well I've been here long enough. It's interesting because my reasoning to get this done now is so that I have the option to leave and go back to <span class="image-container">France <img src="images/France.png" alt="France countryside" class="image"> </span> whenever I want. It would just be easier to have that option, to leave or to come back at some point.
            </p>

            <p>
                In some ways, I feel so American. I watch football <span class="image-container">(go Eagles) <img src="images/go_eagles.png" alt="jason kelce" class="image"> </span>, I got my 
                <span class="image-container"> license <img src="images/license.jpg" alt="license" class="image"></span> at 16, I don't have a detectable accent.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was especially apparent when I received the citizenship question booklet, and they were all the easiest things. It's funny; Ive been in American History classes for years, i know a bunch of random shit, and this tiny 5 question test determines my 'knowledge of america.' 
I feel like everytime I do absorb 'Americanisms' I lose my Frenchness. I've never voted in France and I know more / pay attention to <span class="image-container">politics here <img src="images/politics_here.PNG" alt="me as hilary clinton 7 years ago snap memory" class="image"> </span> even though I can't vote (yet).
            </p>

            <p>
                I remember the exact day I realized my <span class="image-container">inner monologue <img src="images/inner_monologue.png" alt="where i realized my inner monologue is in English" class="image"> </span> was in English. I cried. I felt like I lost something that I could never get back.
            </p>

            <p>
                What's the worst is that while I don't have an accent in English anymore, I have an itsy bitsy tiny one when I speak French. When <span class="image-container">my cousin <img src="images/my_cousin.png" alt="my cousin dimitri" class="image"> </span> told me this a few summers ago...
The Horror!!!!!! My god. It's such a small thing but it means a lot to me. I don't like forgetting French words. I don't like the <span class="image-container">Frenglish that me and my parents have adopted <img src="images/frenglish.png" alt="our texts with english and french" class="image"> </span> I don’t like that I like<span class="image-container"> hot dogs at baseball games <img src="images/hot_dogs.png" alt="hot dogs" class="image"> </span> and I don't like that I can't find a <span class="image-container">(go Eagles) <img src="images/baguette.png" alt="there are no cheap baguettes in NYC" class="image"> </span> in New York city.
            </p>

            <p>
                Something that's been on my mind lately (or always? everyday?) Is the idea of <span class="image-container">home. <img src="images/home1.png" alt="one of the many homes" class="image"> </span> I think just looking with no emotional input the breakdown of where I've been these past 21 years points to somewhere.
            </p>

                <span class="image-container">America. <img src="images/americs.png" alt="america" class="image"> </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                It's been 10 years. I lived in France for 4. and England for 5. Oh my god it has been more than 10 years fuck. Also during the citizenship process I had to <span class="image-container"> recount the times I'd left the country <img src="images/left_country.png" alt="a chart of the amount of times" class="image"> </span> since 2018. I have been to France in the past 5 years for something like 40 days. I saw my family for a total of 6 WEEKS over the course of 5 YEARS. that hit really hard for me. That's why <span class="image-container">home. <img src="images/home2.png" alt="one of the many homes" class="image"> </span> isn’t here. Only my mom and dad are here, everyone else is there.
            </p>

            <p>
                This year, we are spending Christmas there for the first time since I was <span class="image-container">six years old. <img src="images/six_years_old.png" alt="me at 6" class="image"> </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                6 weeks out of 364.
            </p>

            <p>
                And even that feels weird, Because over the years of spending Christmas here with my mom and dad, we created our own <span class="image-container">routines and traditions. <img src="images/routines.png" alt="my family Christmas" class="image"> </span> So that's <span class="image-container">home. <img src="images/home3.png" alt="one of the many homes" class="image"> </span> to me, too. Not doing these traditions doesn’t feel like my Christmas, but at the same time <span class="image-container"> seeing family feels like Christmas, <img src="images/family.png" alt="my family celebrates christmas" class="image"> </span> so on and so forth forever. It’s conflicting, and I feel bad about it. There’s other reasons too like moving etc. but I don’t need to get into that here.
            </p>

            <p>
                Generally America is just. I don’t know. I do. I love it but I don’t but I do but I don’t but I do but I don’t. I think with the shooter thing in Lewiston and <span class="image-container"> Barry <img src="images/barry.png" alt="barry the homie" class="image"> </span> being there I’m thinking about that too. It’s a tangent but not really because as horrible as it is that is American culture. Why would I ever want to be a part of something that’s ok with that? I don’t but I still do and it’s conflicting.
